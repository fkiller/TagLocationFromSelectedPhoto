# Tag Location From Selected Photos

TagLocationFromSelectedPhotos (such a long name) is a quick action made by Automator to automate estimating location of photos by geolocated photos taken before/after the photo. Use case is that you have a iPhone taking photos with GPS locations and a DSLR camera that doesn't have GPS feature at the same time.
